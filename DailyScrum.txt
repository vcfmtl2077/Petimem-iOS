3. Need assistance / figure things out
-need help in designing database structrue
User > pet 1 > events(activities)
     > pet 2 > events(activities)
     > Expenses

Design1:
Collection(Users) > documents(user1) > Collection(pets) > documents(pet1) > Collection(events)
                                                        > documents(pet2) > Collection(events)
                                     > Collection(expenses)
                  > documents(user2) > Collection(pets)

Will this structure have limitation when users scale up?


Design2:
Collection(Users)
Collection(Pets) > documents(pet1) + reference(userId) > Collection(events)
                 > documents(pet2) + reference(userId) > Collection(events)
Collection(expenses) > documents(expense1) + reference(userId)
                     > documents(expense2) + reference(userId)

- I wanted to keep working on the app until it's ready to publish; Can I keep the original design if I am not going to implement functions like album?
- Events supposed to have different kinds of event > Diet > feed
                                                          > treat
                                                   > Outdoor > walk
                                                             > poop
                                                             > pee
                                                   > Care > teeth brushing
                                                          > grooming
                                                   > Health > deworm
                                                            > vaccine
                                                            > weight
                                                            > unusual conditions
